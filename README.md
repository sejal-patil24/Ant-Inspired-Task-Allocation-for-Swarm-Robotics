# Ant-Inspired-Task-Allocation-for-Swarm-Robotics

This project focuses on building a task allocation model inspired by ant behavior to improve the performance and energy efficiency of robotic swarms. The project involves designing and simulating algorithms to handle tasks dynamically in both centralized and distributed systems.

Overview

The aim is to optimize how tasks are allocated among robots in a swarm, inspired by how ants efficiently distribute tasks in their colonies. This helps achieve:

1. Improved performance in task execution.
2. Better energy efficiency for the robotic swarm.

Key Features
1. Task Allocation Model:
   Inspired by ant colony behavior.
   Designed for both centralized and distributed systems to suit different scenarios.

2. Algorithm Comparison:
   Simulated and compared different algorithms to find the best approach.
   Achieved near-optimal task allocation and demonstrated robust scalability.
   
Challenges Addressed 
 1. Dynamic Task Allocation: Adapted to changing environments and workloads.
 2. Scalability: Ensured the model performs well as the number of robots increases.
 3. Energy Efficiency: Minimized energy consumption while completing tasks efficiently.

Simulation Results

The simulations demonstrated that the ant-inspired approach is effective for:
1. Balancing task loads across robots.
2. Scaling up to larger swarms without significant performance drops.

Future Improvements
1. Extend simulations to real-world robotic systems.
2. Explore hybrid approaches combining centralized and distributed methods.
3. Incorporate machine learning to make task allocation even smarter.
